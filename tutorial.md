Installation Instructions
1. Install Python (if not already installed)
   Download and install Python from python.org.
2. Install Jupyter
   You can install Jupyter via pip:

sh
Copy code
pip install jupyter
3. Install the required Python packages
   You can create a requirements.txt file with the following content:

txt
Copy code
transformers
huggingface_hub
fastapi
uvicorn[standard]
python-dotenv
torch  # Ensure you have the appropriate version for your system
Install all dependencies using pip:

sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Alternatively, you can install them individually:

sh
Copy code
pip install transformers huggingface_hub fastapi uvicorn[standard] python-dotenv torch
Detailed Steps
Ensure Python is installed:

Verify Python installation:

sh
Copy code
python --version
Install Jupyter:

sh
Copy code
pip install jupyter
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

Create a virtual environment:

sh
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

sh
Copy code
.\venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:

sh
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Install Python packages:

Create a requirements.txt file with the necessary dependencies:

txt
Copy code
transformers
huggingface_hub
fastapi
uvicorn[standard]
python-dotenv
torch  # Ensure you choose the appropriate version for your hardware (CPU or GPU)
Install all packages using pip:

sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Alternatively, install each package individually:

sh
Copy code
pip install transformers huggingface_hub fastapi uvicorn[standard] python-dotenv torch
Running Jupyter:

Start Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

sh
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open a new Python notebook or terminal within the Jupyter interface.

Summary of Commands
sh
